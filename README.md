# ConsoleGameEngine

A Game Engine for the console in C++ 
Not stable in beta.

Multithreading could make the game slower if the mechanics or the graphics of the game are slower because they have to wait for each other.
There will be a disable function.

Working on Windows.
Looking forward to get it working on Linux.


# Getting Started

There is at the moment not more than the documentary in the code.
There is a [smaple](ConsoleGameEngine/Sample.cpp) to get started with the basics.

# Ideas and Help

Feel free to [Discord](https://discord.gg/TwdM5wCzav) or [eMail](mailto:code@nprommi.de) me about the stuff you need help with. 
For new stuff you want added or old that does not work, you can also make an Issue.
