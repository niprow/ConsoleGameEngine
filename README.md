# ConsoleGameEngine

A Game Engine for the console in C++ 
Not stable in beta.

Multithreading could make the game slower if the mechanics or the graphics of the game are slower because they have to wait for each other.
There will be a disable function.

Working on Windows.
Looking forward to get it working on Linux.


# Getting Started

TODO sample and documentation.
